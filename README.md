# Rent_A-Car
commit

#Task - create a program for a Rent A Car, where Customer can rent and return car. The Reant A Car can rent, and update the available car (when a customer returns car)
#Here we will be demonstrating abstraction and encapsulation (more on encaspulation later)
#=======For the Rent_A_car Class, layers of abstraction ==> *display available cars, *Rent car, *Return car
#=======For the Customer Class, layers of abstraction: ==> *rent a car* and *return a car*
#Note for abstraction: You are only dealing with the important and relevant details of a rent_a_car...not the irrevelant details like no. of shelves, or the cobwebs on the cielings!
